        Keep the html clean at all times fast load into the browser for better speed.

        Every business needs a software consultant that understands the struggle of everyday problems in real world
        for an example, making a client happy and keeping a good relationship with the client at all times
        checking on the clients, ensure that improvements are due where necessary.

        Everyday business is difficult to get hold of with all the scams from the developer side as well as the business side.
        I trust that one day the pain i had to go through will be rewarded by good actions and positive attitude to fair business dealings.

        I hope all projects, open sourced my code projects lives on github. https://github.com/goomatyi
